# Classroom-Allocation-System
Project made for Advanced Programming course (CSE201) in monsoon 2017 semester @ IIIT Delhi
This is a JavaFX based application which can be used by student, faculty and admins in IIIT Delhi. It has different functionalities
for different types of users and some common functionalities for all. Some of these include-
1) Room booking system: Faculty and admin can directly book the room and based on the availability the room is either booked or the user is informed
   that booking can't be made.
2) Time Table: Students can make personalized time tables where in they can search for courses based on post conditions and then add the course as a
   credit or audit course.
3) Request System: Students can not directly book rooms, however they can request for booking of a room, which can then be accepted or rejected by
   the admin. Requests automatically get removed after 5 days if they're still pending.
4) Notification System: Each user gets personalized notifications based on their bookings, classes and request status among many others.
